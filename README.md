# Seam-Carving
Seam Carving Algorithm in C++

I wrote the function DoSeamCarve in the file SeamCarveAlgorithm.cpp. This function takes a saliency map (a 2-dimensional array of energies of individual pixels), width and height of the saliency map, and base width of the saliency map as parameters; see the comments and function headers in the provided file for a more detailed explanation of these inputs. The function returns the x-coordinates of the seam, starting from the top of the image, in an array.
